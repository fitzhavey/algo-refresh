# Hello World

The key tenets of working at Meta are:

- **Communication**
- **Eagerness**
- **Code Quality & Style**

This rest requires a solid understanding of Big(0) notation. The problems are meant to be hard, and so these tests are focused on testing the approach and process of the candidates, rather than the results.

These questions can be HARD. Just because you think you aren't doing well does not make it true <(^^,)>

## What to expect

1. a few minutes of conversation around prior experience
2. 1-2 coding problems (try asking for advice if you need it)
3. an opportunity to ask questions

## Tech Requirements

- mastery of Big(0)
- pick a language you are comfortable with
- implement core data structures from scratch

## Advised Approach

After the interviewer asks a question:

1. ask clarifying questions
2. talk through the approach to finding a solution you see
3. get the solution down in code, it doesn't need to be perfect but should provide a scaffold
4. run sample values (edge cases and larger inputs) through your code and verify the results
