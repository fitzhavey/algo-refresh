# Communication

Interviews aren't all about the technical stuff. It's also important to be able to communicate effectively. This will help you highlight your own skills and to be a good teammate.

## Speaking and Listening

This is about more than being a strong coder, but also being a great engineer and a great teammate. Don't make your interviewer ask you to improve your algorithm, code, etc. Be the one to look for these improvements.

Show your thought process. If your interviewer understands how you're approaching it, they can better:

1. offer suggestions
2. evaluate your approach
3. understand that you're doing great!

Ask questions, like:

- is the data sorted?
- is the tree balanced?
- can I modify the array?
- do I need to print the strings, return the strings, or just return the count?

You really want to avoid finding out 5 minutes into a solution that you're solving the wrong problem.

Propose an initial solution, but also think about its issues.

It's totally normal to make some mistakes, it's important to be open about them. Listen to your interviewer, make sure you capture the value of their hints.
