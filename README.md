# Algorithms Refresh

This repo is a collection of notes and code snippets to refresh my knowledge of algorithms and data structures. The notes are based on the information in Meta's interview preparation hub.

## General Tips

### Coding

This focus area looks at the fluency with which solutions are converted into executable code, including proficiency with the language you chose, code organization, readability, and structure.

The ability to translate your solution into workable, readable code is an important consideration in the coding interview. To improve:

- Practice coding basic algorithms in your language of choice, to increase familiarity with the language itself and how to manipulate common data structures.
- Implement common algorithms like pre-order, in-order and post-order tree traversals and binary search, and basic sorting algorithm like selection sort. Be sure to practice syntax for helper functions and math operations.

### Problem Solving

This focus area considers how you arrive at solutions to coding problems, including the use of appropriate data structures, comparing alternative approaches, and analyzing time and space complexity.

After clearly understanding the problem, finding a general approach to a coding problem is the next step, and often one of the most important parts of the interview.

- **Learn common problem solving strategies.** Check out resources like "Cracking the Coding Interview" and learn about the various classes of problems you may encounter and how to recognize them.
- **Go over data structures, algorithms and complexity.** Brush up on your data structures like lists, arrays, hash tables, hash maps, stacks, queues, graphs, trees, and heaps. Also include common algorithms like sorts, searches, and tree/graph traversals (breadth-first and depth-first searches; pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals). Also review recursion and iterative approaches.
- **Be familiar with analyzing time and space complexity.** Review complexities of common algorithms like searches and tree traversals, and apply those to your time and space analysis.

- **Practice coding problems.** Try as many coding problems as you can. You can start with our Coding Practice section, but feel free to use resources like LeetCode and HackerRank to practice more problems.

### Verification

This focus area looks at whether there were reasonable test cases considered to verify code. In addition, it also looks for the ability to walk or step through the code to find bugs and fix them.

Verifying your code after you write it is important to ensure you arrive at a correct solution. To improve:

- Identify relevant test cases, possibly ones that exercise every codepath or cover common edge cases like empty input, very long input, etc.
- Practice the skill of walking through your code in the problems you do, updating the state of your data structures with each line of code.

### Communication

This focus area measures understanding of the coding problem statement, the clarifying of requirements when needed, and the ability to articulate problem solutions. Additionally, it considers the ability to incorporate hints provided by the interviewer.

Articulating your thoughts as you work through a coding problem is key to making sure that the interviewer is aware of and has context to evaluate your approaches.

- Make sure you ask questions until you fully understand the problem statement and any constraints that it comes with.
- When suggesting a solution, mention its pros and cons, and why you landed on that solution.
- If you need time to gather your thoughts around a solution, you can consider:
  - Asking the interviewer for a minute until you have a clearer idea, or
  - Explaining the parts that are clear, and mentioning to the interviewer which parts youâ€™re trying to break down further.
- As you write your solution out, explain what the code is doing.
- Try to incorporate solution hints that the interviewer may provide during the interview. Feel free to ask questions around the hints if they are unclear.
